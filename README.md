# ECommerce-Backend

## Description

This project was an additional practice for understanding express routes for Back End programming. It allowed me to further my knowledge and understanding of routes and the use of Insomnia for checking to see if the routes were correct. I learned that routes are very similar in syntax but slightly different in a sense that they connect to the the models and model attributes.

## Installation

To install, the user must install necessary npm packages through `npm install` and then log into MySql to load the database with the `schema.sql` file. Next, run `npm run seed` to seed the database with the index.js file, and finally `npm start` to run the app through the localhost port.

## Usage

This is a video is a demo of the steps to set up and test each route through Insomnia:
